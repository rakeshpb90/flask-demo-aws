This CodeDeploy pipeline consists of four stages: Image Checker, Update Spec, Deploy Spec, and Git Spec. Here's a breakdown of each stage:

Image Checker: This stage verifies if the required Docker image exists in the specified region. It executes a script (docker_image_check.sh) that checks the existence of the Docker image. This stage generates output indicating the status of the Docker image, whether it's available or needs to be updated before deployment.

Update Spec: This stage is responsible for updating the Helm values of the specific app[] with the user-supplied Docker image. It executes a script (update_values.sh)  to update the Docker image in Helm values files based on the current environment, application, and the Docker image provided by the user.

Deploy Spec: This stage deploys the application using Helmfile. It executes a deployment script (deploy_script.sh) with parameters specifying the target cluster, environment, application name, deployment command, and namespace.

Git Spec: This stage automates the process of pushing local Docker image changes to a remote Git repository. It involves creating a separate branch, pushing the changes to that branch, creating a pull request (PR), and then merging the PR. It executes a Python script (git_repo.py) designed to automate the Git workflow.
